# DA-Road_Accident-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyse the data. This process involved several stages, including data processing, data cleaning and data visualization.

# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
